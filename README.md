# c-source
My c program source codes that I wrote for learning purposes.

Anyone who thinks they have a better way of doing something than the way I wrote, please teach me by creating [new issue](https://github.com/the-c0d3r/c-source/issues/new) or [new PR](https://github.com/the-c0d3r/c-source/compare)

### Compilation
If anyone wishes to compile the code, they just need to simply clone it and compile with gcc.

    gcc -o outputfilename inputfilename.c
